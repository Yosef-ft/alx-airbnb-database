## Optimization Report
The initial query had a total execution time of 0.263 ms with a planning time of 1.327 ms, using full row selection and multiple sequential scans across all joined tables.

After refactoring by selecting only necessary columns and introducing indexes on key fields, the execution time improved to 0.198 ms and planning time decreased to 0.935 ms. This demonstrates a performance gain through more efficient data access and reduced data load.

Overall, the refactored query is more optimized and performs better.
